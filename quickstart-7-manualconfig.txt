Here are some manual tweaks I've done to bittorrent image that you may find useful:

0) During the install process, most likely a new Linux kernal was installed.  
  - Reboot
  - Update the Virtualbox Guest Additions to get the mouse to work again
    - http://drupal.org/node/788994

1) Disable screensaver.  Host computer takes care of this, just an annoyance to login.
  - System -> Preferences -> uncheck "Activate...", uncheck "Lock..."

2) Auto login.  Host computer takes care of security.
  - System -> Administration -> Login Screen -> Unlock -> Uncheck "Play...", Select "Log in as...", uncheck "Allow"

3) Install security updates automatically.  No sense in skipping this, or doing it manually.
  - System -> Administration -> Software Sources
     -> "Updates" Tab -> Select "Install security...", "Show new distribution..." -> "Normal releases"
     -> "Statistics" Tab -> check "Submit statistical information"

4) Added links to top toolbar (right-click -> Add to Panel...):
  - App Launcher -> Accessories -> Terminal (command line prompt).  It's the black box with a >
  - App Launcher -> Accessories -> Gedit (gui text editor)
  - App Launcher -> Accessories -> Chrome browser
  - System Monitor

5) Firefox 3.6 removed the ability to command-line install extensions.
