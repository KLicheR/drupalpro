Here are some manual tweaks I've done to bittorrent image that you may find useful:

1) Disable screensaver.  Host computer takes care of this, just an annoyance to login.
  - System -> Preferences -> uncheck "Activate...", uncheck "Lock..."

2) Auto login.  Host computer takes care of security.
  - System -> Administration -> Login Screen -> Unlock -> Uncheck "Play...", Select "Log in as..."

3) Install security updates automatically.  No sense in skipping this, or doing it manually.
  - System -> Administration -> Software Sources -> "Updates" Tab -> Select "Install security..."

4) Added links to top toolbar:
  - Terminal (command line prompt).  It's the black box with a >
  - Chrome browser

5) Firefox 3.6 removed the ability to command-line install extensions.
