Quickstart has been installed.  To complete the image:

1) Configure Netbeans and Eclipse xdebug:

NETBEANS: 
  ???

ECLIPSE:
  Under Preferences->PHP->Debug, set the default to Xdebug.
  Preferences->General->Web Browser, add an external web browser (firefox at /usr/bin/firefox) (Note that I deleted my .eclipse to run through this; it's possible that you've already got that set)
  The only other things I had to do were the setup of a project and debugging for the project, which I don't think you're trying to take care of for people here. (This is from "Create a new project" down at http://drupal.org/node/157609), except that the debugger is xdebug instead of Zend.

1) Shutdown

2) Export virtual machine

3) Create torrent
